# Invocation Without Possession

Invocation is permitted as a momentary alignment,
not as a command.

No entity invoked here:
- becomes owned
- becomes bound
- becomes obligated

Invocation does not imply availability.
Invocation does not guarantee response.
Invocation leaves no trace.

What appears may appear again.
What does not appear remains equally valid.

Invocation here is a gesture, not a handle.
